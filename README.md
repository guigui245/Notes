These are a collection of mathematical writings.

I use Sublime Text 3 with LaTeXTools and LaTeXYZ together with Texlive 2020.
You may notice that my style is very verbose as I use almost no custom commands. 
This is because I maintain an extensive file of autocompletion shortcuts, resulting in a more compatible .tex code for other users.
